intro_heading: Surfing is in our blood. It's not just a hobby, it's our way of life. 
intro: "<p>We've surfed waves across the globe and are stoked to see that Canada is earning recognition in the surfing world for high-class surfing and high-class waves. But we noticed that there was something missing in Canada...the surfing community was thriving, but we saw there was a lack of access to high-end boards. Of course, surfers can buy great brands from other countries, but it's ridiculously expensive in shipping costs!</p>
<br>
<p>So we took our years of experience in professional surfing, invested in a shaping machine, and followed the wave. Operating out of Ucluelet, British Columbia, West Coast Shapes manufactures top quality and detailed boards with the most high end shaping machine in the market and best glassing in the world. 160 years of combined experience and a lot of passion go into our boards, boards that are Canadian born, Canadian made. </p>
<br>
<p>Not only are our boards local and affordable, but we are bringing back of models from the olden days! Just like new mustangs were created to look just like the old models but with new technology, our boards offer the charm of old school designs but include modernizing technology, contours, and laminating. </p>
<br>
<p>Canadian surfers are on the rise and with a WCSUkee board in your garage, you can conquer the wave with a solid foundation under your feet.</p>

At that moment, he told his mom that he wanted to do that for the rest of his life. He stepped on a board for the first time at 2 years old and went on to pursue professional surfing. There he developed his passion for longboarding. His specialty is BIG waves, the bigger the better!<br><br>For 25 years TJ has been on the search for new waves, new people, and new things to explore. When he met David at Canadian nationals, all the pieces fell in place to start West Coast Shapes. It's a dream to combine his interest in business and his passion for surfing."
